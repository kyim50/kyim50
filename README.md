## About Me
- 🔭 I’m currently working on "Quests" which is a map-based app designed to foster local connections through spontaneous daily task requests. It encourages face-to-face interactions, particularly helping users with social anxiety, by providing face to face interaction based on everyday tasks to promote networking. The app prioritizes privacy and safety, offering private accounts, activity logs, and location-sharing only during active tasks. Quests aims to make connecting/networking with new people more approachable and engaging.
  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning TypeScript, Python, JavaScript, Java, C++, SQL
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on Riot Game Projects in the future
